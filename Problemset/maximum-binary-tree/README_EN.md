## Description

<p>
Given an integer array with no duplicates. A maximum tree building on this array is defined as follow:
<ol>
<li>The root is the maximum number in the array. </li>
<li>The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from left part subarray divided by the maximum number.</li>
<li>The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from right part subarray divided by the maximum number.</li> 
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Construct the maximum tree by the given array and output the root node of this tree.
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [3,2,1,6,0,5]
<b>Output:</b> return the tree root node representing the following tree:

      6
    /   \
   3     5
    \    / 
     2  0   
       \
